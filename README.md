Source: Around 9000 Tweets, scraped for the hashtag *#ScienceIsGlobal*, to visualize the country connections represented by the co-occurrence of emoji flags. The data collection is [ongoing in this public Google Doc Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NRxvV0JP_eF98WUfbkpj1iMBlFEe25JGKGhblM6U3KQ/edit#gid=56646471).

I added geocoordinates geocoordinates (lat/long) to the data, used the Geo Layout plugin in Gephi, and created three networks, including all edges, edges > 100 or edges > 200, respectively. Western Europe is still quite messy, but I do think the graph is clearer overall ;-)
